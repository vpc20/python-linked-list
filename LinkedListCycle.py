# Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
# To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the
# position(0 - indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to.If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked
# list.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: head = [3, 2, 0, -4], pos = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
