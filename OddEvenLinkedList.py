# Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are
# talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
#
# You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
# Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
#
# Example 2:
# Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
# Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
#
# Note:
#     The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
#     The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
